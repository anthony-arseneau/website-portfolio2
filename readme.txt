## How to Use

You can see the website [here](https://anthonyarseneau.ca/index.html).

## Features
- **Custom Server Setup**: Designed and configured a server infrastructure tailored to hosting a dynamic website.
- **Front-End Development**: Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured consistent functionality and visual integrity across various browsers and devices, requiring meticulous attention to detail.
- **Automation**: Implemented automation features using crontab for efficient server management.

## Technical Stack
- **Server Management**: Personal server configured for optimal performance.
- **Web Development**: Front-end technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Automation Tools**: Crontab for scheduled tasks (e.g., IP updates, website refreshes).
- **Thermal Management**: Integrated cooling system to ensure stable operation under load.

## Project Duration
The learning curve for setting up and managing the server infrastructure was steep, but the experience gained was ultimately rewarding. Front-end development proved to be time-consuming due to the need for extensive testing and refinement.

## Improvements
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Through multiple iterations and problem-solving, my workflow has been significantly optimized. Future website creation will now take a fraction of the time compared to the initial effort.
- **Enhanced System Efficiency**: Automation features and proper cooling systems were implemented to improve performance and stability.
